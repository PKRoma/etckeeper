There is a setting in /etc/etckeepeer.conf like so:
# Uncomment the following to avoid special file warning
# (the option is enabled automatically for daily autocommits regardless).
AVOID_SPECIAL_FILE_WARNING=1

It is commented out by default because of the automatic enabling, but I have enabled it to see wheterh it makes a difference.
