I use etc keeper with git, and some etc files are simultaneous manually managed with RCS (mainly historic reasons)
etckeeper wants to checkin the ,v RCS repository files.

Shouldnt "RCS/*,v" or something be the default in .gitignore

Or more generally, should it ignore repo files for *all* vc systems not just the one its using?

Where would I make this change locally to fix this, so it applies to all directories and version control systems? Right now Ive just amended the git ignore file
