I'd like to be able to `commit` a single change into etckeeper's VCS that reflected more than one `apt` action.

As a developer I prefer to see commits representing a logically complete piece of work,
not something that requires follow-on commits before the system is back in a sane / consistent state.

Consider the case of installing Sublime Text for Linux (** - see bottom), 
there are several steps, all of which are parts of a single logical action that should be committed as one operation into git (or whatever VCS).

* wget ... | apt-key add -
* apt-get install apt-transport-https
* create  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list
* apt-get update
* apt-get install sublime-text

Ideally the work-flow would look like:

* etckeeper begin-transaction
* wget ... | apt-key add -
* git add apt/trusted.gpg
* apt-get install apt-transport-https
  # etckeeper WARNS about uncommitted changes / transaction still open
  # (instead of aborting)
* create  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list
* git add      apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list
* apt-get update
  # etckeeper WARNS...
* apt-get install sublime-text
  # etckeeper WARNS...
* etckeeper finish-transaction # commits to VCS
