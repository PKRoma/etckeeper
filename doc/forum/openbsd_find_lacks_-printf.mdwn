OpenBSD find does not have `-printf` which is used in `/etc/etckeeper/commit.d/50vcs-commit` to figure out who is running the command:

    # uname -a
    OpenBSD myhost 6.9 GENERIC.MP#473 amd64
    # etckeeper commit
    find: -printf: unknown option

I replaced `USER="$(find "$TTY" -printf "%u")"` with `USER=dunno` as this makes it work.

OpenBSD has perl in its base so:

    perl -MFile::stat -E "my \$st = stat(\"$TTY\"); say( (getpwuid(\$st->uid))[0] )";

or

    perl -MFile::stat -E "my \$st = stat(qq{$TTY}); say( (getpwuid(\$st->uid))[0] )";

would work.
