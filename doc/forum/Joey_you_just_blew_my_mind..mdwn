While trying to add etckeeper to some other system today, I ran:

    $ etckeeper help
    etckeeper: /etc/etckeeper/help.d does not exist

And now I'm wondering why I don't just make *all* of my big scripts call `run-parts` on the subcommands.

# Why was I not informed sooner?

Anyway thanks, Joey, I learned a cool new trick today!
