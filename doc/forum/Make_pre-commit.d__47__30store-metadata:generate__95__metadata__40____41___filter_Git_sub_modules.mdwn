It would be great if the function generate_metadata() in pre-commit.d/30store-metadata would not only filter ignore patterns from .gitignore, but if it would also filter any files inside Git sub modules.

Information about Git sub modules is being stored in a .gitmodules files, similar to this (example):
```
[submodule "path/to/dir"]
        path = path/to/dir
        url = https://...
```
