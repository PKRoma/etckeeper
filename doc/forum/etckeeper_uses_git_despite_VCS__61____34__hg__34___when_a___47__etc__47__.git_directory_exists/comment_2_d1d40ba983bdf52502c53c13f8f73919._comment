Thank your for the info, I found your mentioned TODO at *[[todo/Give preference to etckeeper.conf over existing repository for defining $VCS]]*.

I was able to accomplish my scenario (one personal git repository with <del>cherry-picked</del> selected configuration files in one repository AND using etckeeper as well) with the following workaround setup:

* Set up my personal git repository at the root filesystem location `/`.
* Configure etckeeper to use mercurial/hg.

I noticed that (at least in Debian 11.2 bullseye) `apt install etckeeper` automatically runs `etckeeper init`, thereby setting up a **git**-based etckeeper according to the [default `etckeeper.conf` file](https://git.joeyh.name/index.cgi/etckeeper.git/tree/etckeeper.conf?h=debian&id=e2efb7797cfc0a6b366a9db01d37f685ccf04e22) - but I want **hg**. I looked around, but there doesn't currently seem to be a way (e.g. *debconf*) to configure etckeeper at *pre-installation time* to use hg other than [having an appropriate `/etc/etckeeper/etckeeper.conf` file in place before running `apt install etckeeper`](https://git.joeyh.name/index.cgi/etckeeper.git/tree/debian/postinst?h=debian&id=e2efb7797cfc0a6b366a9db01d37f685ccf04e22#n80). Or is there? Thanks for your help!
