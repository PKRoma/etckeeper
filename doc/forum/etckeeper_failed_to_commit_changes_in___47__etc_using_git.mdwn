Hello,

I am having issues with etckeeper, failing to commit changes:
	Changes not staged for commit:
	(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	(commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)
			modified:   letsencrypt/letsencrypt-autoupdater (modified content)
	
	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
	warning: etckeeper failed to commit changes in /etc using git
	(Reading database ... 206470 files and directories currently installed.)
	Removing knxd-build-deps (0.14.42-1) ...
	On branch master
	Changes not staged for commit:
	(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
	(use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	(commit or discard the untracked or modified content in submodules)
			modified:   letsencrypt/letsencrypt-autoupdater (modified content)
	
	no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


I did try a git add letsencrypt/letsencrypt-autoupdater and git commit -a with no effect.

Can you tell me, how to fix this?

Regards,
Hendrik
