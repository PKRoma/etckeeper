It seems systemd-update-done writes the file
<https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-update-done.service.html>,
but on my Debian system that service is not included. It's only needed
for a factory reset kind of feature, which probably does not make sense to
include in many linux distributions.

I'm not sure if it necessarily makes sense to avoid it in all cases.
If systemd is depending on that state for something it might make sense to
restore it.
