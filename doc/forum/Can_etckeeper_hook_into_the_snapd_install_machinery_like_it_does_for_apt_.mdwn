I like that etckeeper can block my attempt at apt-get installing anything when there are pending changes in /etc


Can this also be done with stuff installed from the Snap Store (https://snapcraft.io/store)?


I've been looking for the git repository for this project to look for an issue tracker, but couldn't find anything 'official'.

Cheers
