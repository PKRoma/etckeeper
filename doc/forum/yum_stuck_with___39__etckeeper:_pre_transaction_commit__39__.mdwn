Whenever I try to install something on CentOS (release 7.8.2003, installed via epel) etckeeper pre/auto commit ll get stuck mostly on pre commit. 
I also got one server where post commit fails me, but on there one I can just abort the command.

etckeeper-1.18.14-1.el7.noarch
git-1.8.3.1-23.el7_8.x86_64

```

For now, the workaround is to disable the yum-plugin with the config file /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/etckeeper.conf
