These files are unlikely to change without their originals changing too, so
how is that unncessary churn? (And if they did change without the originals
changing, that seems like the kind of event it might be useful to have a
record of.)

And the hash of the files is the same as the hash of a previous
version of the original, so including them does not even use more disk
space.

Aside from gratuitous files that do not belong in /etc, etckeeper should
accurately reflact the actual contents of the directory by default. To do
otherwise risks being surprising.
