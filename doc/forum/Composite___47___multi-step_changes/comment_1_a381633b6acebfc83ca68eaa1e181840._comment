One way to accomplish this is to `git branch -f transaction master` at the
start, and once all intermediate commits have been made (by etckeeper or by
you), run `git reset transaction; etckeeper commit "transaction
description"`.

It's also sometimes handy to then generate a merge commit between the final
transaction commit and the last intermediate commit; then you have both
the transactions and all the intermediate steps accessible in git log; 
the git history has a diamond shape.

I'd be willing to consider patches along these lines..
