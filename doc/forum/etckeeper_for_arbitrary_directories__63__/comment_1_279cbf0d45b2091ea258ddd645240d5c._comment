I choose not to grow etckeeper in this direction, because focus is
important: etckeeper needs to be as good as possible at version controlling
/etc, even if that means choices that don't make any sense for version
controlling another directory.

If you're going to version control a whole system, or some
subset of it, you have a number of hard problems to solve.
etckeeper solves probably none of them, except for the solution of "let's
only version control /etc and so those other problems are not our problems".

So it is not a useful starting point to do that, probably. If it somehow
is a useful starting point to that, forking it would be appropriate.
