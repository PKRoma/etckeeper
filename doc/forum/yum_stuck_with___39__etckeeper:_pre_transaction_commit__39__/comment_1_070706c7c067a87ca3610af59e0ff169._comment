I suggest you talk to the distribution maintainers about the problem,
since etckeeper is included in centos, this is certianly an integration bug
there, and one they should be well suited to dealing with. Even if it ought
to be eventually fixed in etckeeper itself.

(Jimmy Tang wrote the yum integration, but it was so long ago that I doubt
trying to get in touch with him would be useful.)
