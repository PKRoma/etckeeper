Another problem with busybox ps and that patch is that while `ps 1`
normally shows only pid 1, `busybox ps 1` lists all pids.

So it doesn't seem that code path can support busybox ps at all,
and probably the safest thing to do is to use --no-headers to make procps's
ps always do the right thing no matter how configured, and if that fails,
/dev/null the error and fall back to not including the command line in
the commit message.
