etckeeper is a collection of tools to let `/etc` be stored in a git,
mercurial, bazaar or darcs repository. This lets you use git to review or
revert changes that were made to `/etc`. Or even push the repository
elsewhere for backups or cherry-picking configuration changes.

It hooks into package managers like apt to automatically commit changes
made to /etc during package upgrades. It tracks file metadata that git does
not normally support, but that is important for /etc, such as the
permissions of `/etc/shadow`.

It's quite modular and configurable, while also being simple to use if you
understand the basics of working with version control.
