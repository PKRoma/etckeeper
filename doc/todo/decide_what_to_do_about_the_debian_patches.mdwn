There is a number of patches in the Debian BTS that has been pending
since before I took over maintainership of the package. I am wondering
what to do with them - a bunch seem relevant and I could bundle them
in `debian/patches` but I am not sure I want to carry such a "fork" of
etckeeper forever, so I would prefer to approve them here first.

On the other hand, I do not want to flood you with 8 feature requests
you have already seen. So I figured I would open a single todo item to
quickly allow you to review the [patch set](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?include=tags%3Apatch&exclude=tags%3Apending&pend-exc=done&repeatmerged=no&src=etckeeper):

 * #519420 etckeeper: Add option to force commit after apt run.
 
   Hack to force an empty commit to keep track of package changes.

   Last change: Apr 2009. Marked "wontfix" in 2014.
 
 * #549354 etckeeper: don't warn about ignored files
 
   git-specific patch available, not sure how it behaves with other
   VCSes. seems to have at least another user (fmarier)

   Last change: Oct 2010.

 * #576915 30store-metadata: use GNUisms to achieve 1s runtime.
 
   concerns about portability to solaris, is this still an issue?
   
   Last change: Apr 2010.

 * #592158 etckeeper: Example for tracking installed packages
 
   sample post-install hook to keep track of installed packages in
   /etc. similar to #519420 - close?
   
   Last change: Aug 2010

 * #612029 etckeeper: Example hook for generating GPG-encrypted bundle
   after every commit
   
   another sample post-install hook to secretely ship a git bundle to
   a backup server
   
   Last change: Feb 2011

 * #613278 etckeeper: writing a commit message for the autocommit that
   happens after apt
   
   patch for git, with possible patch for bzr as well, requiring
   proposed upstream change for bzr, not merged.
   
   last change: Sep 2013
   
 * #698062 logout hook
 
   yet *another* sample hook, by yours truly, add a new "logout"
   subcommand that can be added to bash_logout scripts.
   
   last change: Jan 2013

 * #777612 etckeeper should read XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config
 
   look in standard locations for the git config, seems sound
   
   last change: Feb 2015

So to simplify, there are those groups of proposed changes:

 * sample hooks (592158, 612029, 698062)
 * bugfixes (549354, 777612)
 * features and improvements (519420, 576915, 613278)

So any opinion about what to do with those? Should I submit them as
separate issues? Or should I ask the original reporters to do that
here? Or should I just close those issues?
