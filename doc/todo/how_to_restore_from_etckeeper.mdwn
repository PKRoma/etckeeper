Could we get in the README some info about how to restore from etckeeper assuming it's even possible. So say I hose my system. I reinstall everything.  But now I'd like to migrate my old config but keep tracking changes going forward. What I've tried:

1) Renaming /etc breaks sudo
2) clone over /etc breaks passwd
3) clone to staging area and then move things over selectively

Is #3 the proper way to restore an /etc

Thanks
