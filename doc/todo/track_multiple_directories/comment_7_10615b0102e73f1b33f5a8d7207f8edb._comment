This is very much needed!
Example of some folders in debian/ubuntu that people want to keep track of:
/var/spool/cron/crontabs - user crontabs, yes you can use /etc/cron.d but not everyone does.
/lib/ufw/ - If you use ufw, the rules will be saved here
/usr/local/bin - for your own shellscripts and stuff
