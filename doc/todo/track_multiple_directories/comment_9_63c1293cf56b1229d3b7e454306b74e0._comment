Hello. 
Please take a look:
https://github.com/joeyh/etckeeper/pull/30

I tried to add support for multiple dirs for all commands, and leave it compatible with default old config and cli.

This feature may be useful when you want to have more control on your system. There are other locations which do contain config/code that may be changed, and affects system, e.g.: 
python code at /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/
pacemaker scripts at /usr/lib/ocf/resource.d/fuel
libvirt vms xmls at /var/lib/nova/instances/*/*.xml
...
