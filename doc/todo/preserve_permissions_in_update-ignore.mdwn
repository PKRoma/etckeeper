I've recently noticed that update-ignore forces my /etc/.gitignore permissions to be 0600. I've written up [a patch to let it preserve any preexisting VCS ignore file's permissions and ownership](https://gitlab.com/eefi/etckeeper/-/commit/3b824ea5c8218022347a325a20811a84efa6feb7).

The main practical impact of the current state before this patch is that, at least on Debian systems, the second commit into the /etc repo is sullied by an unexpected edit to /etc/.etckeeper updating the permissions for .gitignore from 0644 to 0600. This happens through the following course of events:

1. During initial etckeeper package installation, the postinst runs `etckeeper init`, creating a 0644 .gitignore file, because update-ignore just follows the active umask when creating a brand new VCS ignore file.
2. This initial `etckeeper init` creates a first commit that includes an .etckeeper that records the 0644 permissions for .gitignore.
3. Still during this initial etckeeper package installation, the last step of postinst is to run `etckeeper update-ignore`. This causes the permissions on .gitignore to be changed to 0600.
4. The administrator makes some changes in /etc.
5. The administrator uses `etckeeper vcs status` (or `git -C /etc status`) to check what she's about to commit. Because .etckeeper usually isn't updated until the pre-commit is run, the pending change to the .gitignore permissions isn't shown.
6. The administrator commits her changes. The pre-commit hook updates .etckeeper with .gitignore's new permissions, and that change gets silently lumped in with the other changes actually explicitly planned by the administrator.

My patch takes the approach of preserving any special permissions and ownership an administrator might set. An alternative could be to make update-ignore force root:root 0600 always, by making the results from creating a new VCS ignore file match the results when updating an existing VCS ignore file. But either way, I'd propose that update-ignore be made consistent.

The following are details from `git request-pull` for where to get the specific commit I'm requesting get pulled.
