I am trying to make etckeeper track `/etc` and another folder in `/`.

However the script `20-warn-problem-files` reports many errors like

    find: `./proc/7010/task/7010/fd/5': No such file or directory
    find: `./proc/7010/task/7010/fd/5': No such file or directory
    find: `./proc/7010/task/7010/fd/5': No such file or directory
    find: `./proc/7010/task/7010/fdinfo/5': No such file or directory
    find: `./proc/7010/task/7010/fdinfo/5': No such file or directory
    find: `./proc/7010/task/7010/fdinfo/5': No such file or directory

Due to files in `/proc` being created and deleted while `find` is running.


I am not sure why `find` needs to run at all, when instead one could analyze the output of git ls-files and see if any of those files are problematic.
