etckeeper fails to track symlinks to /dev/null, as created by `systemctl mask X`.

This is because git refuses to track symlinks to files which lie outside the git repository.

Supporting symlinks outside the repository is also required for /etc/alternatives.

- Huh, I was 100% wrong. [[done]]. Some user error, I can't work out what though.
