[[https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/368850/ansible-role-why-do-i-have-to-set-user-email-in-etckeeper/368851]]

etckeeper expects that users set git `user.email`.  But it does not document this, or suggest a best way to do it.

In common usage, this expectation is masked.  I believe the conditions for it breaking are:

1. user.email is not set in git, AND
2. the system hostname cannot be resolved to an FQDN, AND
3. /etc/mailname does not exist (it is created by the Debian exim packages?) AND
4. etckeeper is not run from sudo AND
5. etckeeper is not run from a tty

In this situation, etckeeper requires users to set `user.email` in /root/.gitconfig, or to have set it in /etc/.git/config immediately after `etckeeper init`.

This is not Ansible-specific: the last two conditions will also arise in the daily autocommit script.

IMO, considering how to document this behaviour shows it to be user-unfriendly.  Therefore, it would be simplest if etckeeper could fall back to using `$(id -un)`, once `$(tty)` fails.
