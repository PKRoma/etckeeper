I'm using etckeeper with hg and I will use git to manage some files under /etc apart from etckeeper for some reason.

However, after I initialize new git repository as /etc/.git, etckeeper starts to use git as $VCS contrary to definition in etckeeper.conf. So I think that definition in etckeeper.conf should be given priority over existing repository.

The patch is below (from https://github.com/hiraku/etckeeper/commit/02f6d37e50cacddc9605dcbc5c8844b3f4658d6e ):

I would appreciate your consideration.

Thank you.
