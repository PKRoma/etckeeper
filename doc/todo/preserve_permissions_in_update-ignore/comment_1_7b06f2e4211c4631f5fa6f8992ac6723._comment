Crucially, etckeeper does not write anything sensitive to .gitignore,
so there's no information exposure risk, except for anything the admin may
choose to put in it. So it's fine to leave it 0644 by default on new
installs. Conversely, etckeeper can't easily tell if the admin might have
put something sensitive into .gitignore, so it should not try to force the
permissions back to 0644 on existing installs that have inherited the temp
file permissions.

Ingenious way to preserve the permissions there. I checked and busybox cp
supports -fp, so it should bee portable enough to not be a problem.

I'm applying this patch.
