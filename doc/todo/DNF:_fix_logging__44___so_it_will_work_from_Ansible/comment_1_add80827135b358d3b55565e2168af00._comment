Please find a revised commit in the dnf branch of https://github.com/sourcejedi/etckeeper.git

commit id: afbdce2d24b46bc91840044b953aca8b68f20fd3

(The previous commit was not as safe as I thought.

If the etckeeper output includes an un-decodable byte, we would convert it to a unicode string which contains U+FFFD.  This codepoint is *not* available in all character encodings, so it can cause UnicodeEncodeError.  It's not fatal in current versions of dnf, because they set logging.RaiseExceptions = false.  However it could lose an entire line of output.)
