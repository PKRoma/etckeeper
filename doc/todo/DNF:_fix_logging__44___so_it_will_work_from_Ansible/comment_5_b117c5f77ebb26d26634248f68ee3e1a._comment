See same github repo, branch \"dnf2\", commit 7cda9678b1e60c0495a2a522721b319843d5fae0

Sorry for the delay. I can't find a record of an email notification.

In response to Joey's comment, I've tried sending all the etckeeper output to /dev/null.  I find the resulting code more friendly to read, because it avoids my very long code comment :).

I interpreted \"in this case\" as just meaning \"in etckeeper-dnf\".  I think you could technically check whether you are dnf v.s. a different libdnf client like Ansible, but I didn't want to :).

syslog.syslog() did not seem very helpful.  In python2 it appears to encode unicode using ascii, regardless of the locale.  I think we might be able to drop support for python2-dnf.  But still, the system log seems a bit unexpected, compared to stderr, /var/log/dnf.plugin.log, /var/log/dnf.log, or whatever custom logger the host program set up.
