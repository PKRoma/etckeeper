In Fedora, we have that patch for a while now. However recently, someone [stumbled](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1917461) over the issue joey described in his last comment. Seems like there is indeed only a warning and dnf continues instead of cancelling package installation.

The commit message of the [patch](https://github.com/sourcejedi/etckeeper/commit/8266a4fb) reads:

> For the pre-transaction etckeeper run, this message replaces an exception. So we now avoid logging a traceback, which did not appear to add anything useful.  (In my testing, dnf was continued to install after the exception was logged).

hence I suspect, some more investigation has to happen on how to actually cancel the transaction from within a dnf plugin/hook?
