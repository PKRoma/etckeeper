dnf2 sinks etckeeper's stdout and stderr to /dev/null

`etckeeper pre-install`, when `AVOID_COMMIT_BEFORE_INSTALL` is set,
outputs an error to stderr, and exits nonzero. The expectation is
that the package installation is canceled. (I don't know if that happens
with etckeeper-dnf; it kind of looks like it warns and continues?)

If etckeeper pre-install exiting nonzero does prevent the upgrade from
happening, and the message about it goes to /dev/null, that seems like a
surprising situation for the user to be confronted with.
