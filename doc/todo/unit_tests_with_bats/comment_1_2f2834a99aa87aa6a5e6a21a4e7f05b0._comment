Wow, it's a very nice gift to add a test suite!

When I tried running it on debian unstable, there were two test failures:

	   (in test file test-etckeeper, line 32)
	     `[ $(grep -E -c "^${mkdir_str} .*${testdir2}\'$" $metadata) -eq 1 ]' failed
	 âœ— test: etckeeper commit non-default mode
	   (in test file test-etckeeper, line 51)
	     `[ $(grep -E -c "^${chmod_str} ${mode} .*${testfile}\'$" $metadata) -eq 1 ]' failed

Unless your test suite found some bugs (which perhaps it did already, I
noticed the bugfix commit fad539b0ed762a7f6bc1bd94e64351ef56a25f2a and
have already merged that one), I think this must be a bug in the test
suite. Perhaps a portability issue?

Hmm, I think it's shell quoting fun:

	$ grep file2 /tmp/f
	maybe chmod 0577 './file2'
	$ grep -E -c "^maybe chmod 0577 .*file2\'$" /tmp/f
	0
	$ grep -E -c '^maybe chmod 0577 .*file2'\''$' /tmp/f
	1
	$ echo "^maybe chmod 0577 .*file2\'$"
	^maybe chmod 0577 .*file2\'$
	$ echo '^maybe chmod 0577 .*file2'\''$'
	^maybe chmod 0577 .*file2'$

Indeed, when I change all the greps to not slash-escape the single quote,
the test suite succeeds here. So why are those single quotes being slash-escaped?
As far as I know, shells don't treat single quotes inside double quotes
specially, and I don't think that egrep treats single quotes specially either.
