Reviewing this patch, I noticed a bug in the first hunk. lsscripts
currently limits the files it finds to those matching a regexp. IIRC, this
is needed, amoung other things, to avoid .dpkg-old files being run.

Looking at the second hunk, I suspect that calling `id` twice per file is
going to be significantly slower than the perl implementation.

There also seems to be missing escaping of single quotes in filenames in
the second hunk.
