Gave this a try, and the nested repo gets commited as a submodule, which
makes a certain amount of sense. But /etc/.etckeeper includes directories
and files inside the rested repo, including even in its .git/ directory.

The way pre-commit.d/30store-metadata finds files, and empty
subdirectories, would need to be changed to take nested git repos into
account. I don't immediately see a good way.
