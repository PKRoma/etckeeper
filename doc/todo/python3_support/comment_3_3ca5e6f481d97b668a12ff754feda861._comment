I think that, since I've removed the debian directory upstream,
the only relevant thing would be adding the new etckeeper-brz
and perhaps dropping etckeeper-bzr. And maybe something about changing the
PYTHON value in Makefile, but since that also affects etckeeper-dnf,
it would need to be checked that that at least builds too.

If someone wants to submit that as a git branch, ok.. Untangling it
from a debian patch that includes other changes, including ones that
don't actually do anything (http://bugs.debian.org/975562) does not
appeal to me myself.
