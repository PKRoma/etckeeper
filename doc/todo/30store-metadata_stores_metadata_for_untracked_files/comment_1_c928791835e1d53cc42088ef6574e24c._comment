I don't support using etckeeper to version control stuff other than /etc.

30store-metadata gets a list of all fils git is configured to ignore,
and then runs a find and uses grep to exclude files in that list.

I've verified this seems to work ok when etckeeper is used the usual way in
/etc. Something about the non-supported way you're using etckeeper must be
causing the problem.

Perhaps git ls-files -oi --exclude-standard
when run in / somehow doesn't list every single file in your entire
computer, for whatever reason. When I tried putting a git repo in /.git/
and running that, it hung for a long time.

Sorry, I'm going to close this.
