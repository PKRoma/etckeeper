Such a post-checkout hook makes sense, and yes, `etckeeper init` only
restores file permissions when run in an existing repository.

Do note that there's a window where files that are supposed to be private
may be exposed, depending on your umask, before the permissions are fixed
up. So I can't completely recommend doing this. It might be good to make
it install a post-checkout hook that both fixes the permissions and warns
that what the user is doing is not entirely safe.
