I tried, as an experiment, adding a copy of etckeeper.service and
etckeeper.timer with a different name (netkeeper).

They were not enabled after writing the files, or after a systemctl
daemon-reload. I even tried rebooting, and they're still not enabled.

Next experiment: I uninstalled etckeeper and deleted the symlink in /etc for
its timer. systemd no longer had the timer enabled. I then reinstalled it
with apt. systemd still didn't have the timer enabled, the symlink did not
come back. (Even after rebooting.)

So, I'd think that there is no bug at all, except I am seeing the timer be
enabled by that symlink on multiple machines, including a machine that I'm
positive I've deployed entirely from configuration management. And I'm
pretty sure I never manually enabled it on any of the machines I see it
enabled on.

Maybe something used to cause the timer to get auto-enabled and no longer
does?
