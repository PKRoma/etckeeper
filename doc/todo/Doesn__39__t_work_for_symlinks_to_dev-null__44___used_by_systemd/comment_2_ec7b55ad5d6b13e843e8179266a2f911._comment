Huh, I was 100% wrong.  [[done]].  Some user error, I can't work out what though.

I'm fairly sure this was when I masked fwupd.service.  That was on Fedora 25 Workstation, my current laptop.

I can successfully use `git log` on either /etc/systemd/system or `-- /etc/systemd/system/fwupd.service`, and I see the service being masked and later unmasked.
