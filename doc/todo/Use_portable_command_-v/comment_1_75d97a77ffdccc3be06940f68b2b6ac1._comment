The way this was presented left me at sea about the rationalle for the change.
I had to read the commit message (which was excellent) to understand.

Surprising to me that posh is apparently out of date on standards, and I
could not find a bug report on it to get it updated either. However, 
I was quickly able to find command -v use in scripts on a debian system, so
anyone using posh as their system shell is already experiencing other breakage.
So no worries on that front. Applying as-is.
