Good idea!

Reviewing the patch, I noticed that dpkg -S is run once per changed file.
It should be faster to pass all the changed files to it, and parse the
output.

(Other package managers may also be able to be optimised this way,
but I only care about dpkg, and happen to know dpkg -S can be pretty
slow.. rpm -qf may be fast enough that running repeatedly is not a
problem.)

I think that the "Non-package (maintainer script/removed package)
configuration files changed" list can be omitted. At least on debian there
are unfortunately going to be a lot of such files, and it seems just added
noise in the commit log, and added complication to build the list.

Please use tabs and not spaces for indentation, in keeping with the rest of
etckeeper's code.
