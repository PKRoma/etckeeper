That patch makes etckeeper only commit changes that have been 
staged (eg added with `git add`). If a file has been changed,
but not staged, `git diff --cached` will ignore the change,
and it won't get committed. So the patch is broken.

On debian, a daily cron job uses `etckeeper unclean` to determine if there
are any changes in need of committing. That works with every VCS that
etckeeper supports, and my suggestion is that netbsd use the same
mechanism.
