there are two bugs in the Debian BTS that should probably be upstreamed here. I'm bundling them together because they are related, but it's true they are two distinct issues.

 * [Please don't start both cron job and systemd.timer](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=883263)
 * [daily autocommit is run even though AVOID_DAILY_AUTOCOMMITS=1](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=884824)

I bundle them because they somewhat depend on each other. Could you review those patches and see if they are appropriate?

They at least look good to me and I'm considering inclusion in the next upload...
