> I guess the idea with setting LC_CTYPE=C is not to force this error message to English, which would not be useful, but because whatever the locale is set to is causing grep to interpret the input as binary.

Exactly.

> Except.. the C locale seems equally likely cause that as whatever locale they are using? Indeed the one user who mentioned their locale was using de_DE.utf8 so why would setting C help at all?

Because, according to the `grep`'s man page: \"In the C or POSIX locale, all characters are encoded as a single byte and every byte is a valid character.\"

> grep is complaining about its stdin, which comes from running a find in /etc, so there must be some particular file whose name causes grep to behave this way. Apparently one that, in a unicode locale, grep thinks is not unicode, but binary.

While I don't know which files caused the issue for the reporters of the two bugs, I was able to reproduce the issue by running `touch  $'\xf6'` in `/etc`, creating a file named 'รถ' in a latin-1 locale, but with an invalid name if interpreted as utf-8. (This can also be seen running `find /etc | iconv -f utf8 - -o /dev/null` which yields `iconv: illegal input sequence at position XY`.)
