I'm not thrilled by this idea. It's not uncommon for etckeeper.conf to be
packaged by a distribution. Upgrading the package may replace the
local etckeeper.conf (takes only answering "Y" on debian). If that changes
out the VCS setting, then etckeeper suddently stops using the repository it
was using.

The README documents how to change the VCS that etckeeper uses. So I think
it would be better to document that VCS setting in etckeeper.conf only
applies to `etckeeper init`. Or alternatively, to add a parameter like
`etckeeper init --vcs=git`.

It's true that neither of those options would cater to a system that has
two different version control repositories checked out in /etc at the same
time, but that sounds like a sufficiently strange/bad idea that I see no
reason to cater to it.
