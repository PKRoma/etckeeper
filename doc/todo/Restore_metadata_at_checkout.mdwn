Every time I switch a branch and files get replaced, they are not in the chmod they should be (because of my umask). So I've added a post-checkout hook "etckeeper init".

Do I understand it right, that this doesn't do anything but setting the file permissions correctly, as per .etckeeper file?

Saving metadata i.e. file permissions is the primary reason using etckeeper instead of plain git. What would speak against setting that up by default?

/etc/.git/hooks/post-checkout:

    #!/bin/sh
    # post-checkout hook for etckeeper, to restore metadata
    set -e
    etckeeper init -d /etc
